# Go Array Index Out of Bounds Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: accessing an array index beyond its bounds.  The code attempts to iterate over an array using a loop condition that's off by one, leading to a runtime panic.
The `bug.go` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.go` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Go to prevent unexpected program crashes.
